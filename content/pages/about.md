## Hi, lovely to see you here

First to the maybe a bit boring part ðŸ˜ƒ
Let me introduce myself. Iâ€™m Stefan, Software Engineer since August 2012 and Tech enthusiast since I was born, always looking for new and exciting Tech. Father of a Son since October 2020, living in Austria

I worked in various companies, from Industry 4.0 to Rails, and now in the crypto space.

### What can you expect from this blog?

I always wanted to start blogging. I need to find what I want to post. Prepare for some Software Development, 3d Printing, Miniature painting, D&D, and other Topics that come to my mind and might be interesting for you well ðŸ˜Œ

I want to keep this blog as a tracker and add free as possible but if you're going to support me, visit the donation page.

#### Feel free to contact me if you want anything explained in more detail
